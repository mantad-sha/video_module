/**
 * CSV Export Functionality Test
 * 
 * This file documents how the CSV export works on the /videos/tracking page
 * and how it respects Anonymous Mode.
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
 * 
 * 1. Pure browser-based CSV generation (no external dependencies)
 * 2. Uses Blob API and temporary download link
 * 3. Filename: videos-tracking.csv
 * 4. Respects Anonymous Mode by disabling export
 * 
 * CSV STRUCTURE:
 * - Headers: Video Title, Sent Count, Views, Last Sent, Last Viewed
 * - Data: Quoted values to handle commas in titles
 * - Format: Standard CSV with comma separators
 * 
 * MANUAL TEST STEPS:
 * 
 * Test 1: Normal Export
 * 1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/videos/tracking
 * 2. Ensure Anonymous Mode is OFF
 * 3. Click "Export CSV" button
 * 4. Verify: File downloads as "videos-tracking.csv"
 * 5. Open CSV file
 * 6. Verify: Headers and data are properly formatted
 * 
 * Test 2: Anonymous Mode Disabled
 * 1. Enable Anonymous Mode (press 'A')
 * 2. Hover over "Export CSV" button
 * 3. Verify: Tooltip shows "Disabled while Anonymous Mode is active"
 * 4. Try clicking the button
 * 5. Verify: Nothing happens (button is disabled)
 * 6. Verify: Button has reduced opacity (40%)
 * 
 * Test 3: Data Integrity
 * 1. With Anonymous Mode OFF, export CSV
 * 2. Open the CSV file in Excel or text editor
 * 3. Verify data:
 *    - Video titles match the table
 *    - Sent counts are correct
 *    - View counts are correct
 *    - Timestamps are in proper format
 * 
 * BROWSER CONSOLE TEST:

  console.log('Generated CSV Content:')
  console.log(csvContent)

  // Test blob creation
  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: 'text/csv;charset=utf-8;' })
  console.log('Blob created:', blob)
  console.log('Blob size:', blob.size, 'bytes')
  console.log('Blob type:', blob.type)

  // Test URL creation
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  console.log('Download URL:', url)

  // Clean up
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
  console.log('âœ… CSV export test completed successfully')
}

/**
 * ANONYMOUS MODE INTERACTION:
 * 
 * When Anonymous Mode is ON:
 * - Export button is disabled (opacity: 40%)
 * - Cursor shows as not-allowed
 * - Tooltip appears on hover: "Disabled while Anonymous Mode is active"
 * - Click events are prevented
 * - No CSV file is generated or downloaded
 * 
 * When Anonymous Mode is OFF:
 * - Export button is fully functional
 * - CSV downloads with all data intact
 * - Success toast shows: "CSV file exported successfully"
 * 
 * SAMPLE CSV OUTPUT:
 * 
 * Video Title,Sent Count,Views,Last Sent,Last Viewed
 * "Knee Surgery Preparation","12","234","2024-01-15 14:30","2024-01-16 09:15"
 * "Spine Surgery Rehabilitation","8","156","2024-01-14 11:20","2024-01-15 16:45"
 * "Proper Teeth Cleaning Technique","45","892","2024-01-16 08:00","2024-01-16 12:30"
 * "Pre-Procedure Consultation","3","45","2024-01-13 15:15","2024-01-14 10:00"
 * 
 * TECHNICAL NOTES:
 * 
 * 1. Uses native Blob API (supported in all modern browsers)
 * 2. Creates temporary anchor element for download
 * 3. Automatically triggers download without user interaction
 * 4. Cleans up object URL to prevent memory leaks
 * 5. All processing happens client-side (no server required)
 * 
 * To run the test in browser console:
 * 1. Navigate to /videos/tracking
 * 2. Open DevTools Console
 * 3. Copy and paste the testCSVExport function
 * 4. Run: testCSVExport()
